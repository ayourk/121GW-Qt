# Application (v2.05) — architecture map

Image: `dumps/app.bin` = flash 0x08006000–0x080294E7 (144,616 bytes), byte-identical to `EEVBlog2_05.bin`. Status: fully rebuilt in C, equivalent in emulation, and running on the meter.

## Build facts

- IAR EWARM, but **a different compiler version or optimisation level from the bootloader**: `GPIO_Init` is 164 bytes here and 168 in the bootloader. Only 70 of 794 functions match the bootloader exactly (`tools/match_functions.py`, `docs/app_matches.tsv`).
- 794 functions (119 KB of code). The rest is tables, including about 11 KB of 32-bit correction tables at 0x08026068–0x08028CDC.
- **RAM:** 0x23E bytes of initialised data at 0x20000000, stored **LZ77-compressed** in flash at 0x08029344 and unpacked by IAR's `__iar_lz77_init_single3` (0x080287C0). `tools/iar_lz77.py` reproduces it, and the unpacked image is `dumps/app_data_init.bin`. Next comes the stack (4 KB, initial SP 0x20001240), then 0x6EBC bytes of zeroed globals (0x20001240–0x200080FB).
- The initialised data is mostly the CSV log text: header fields (`ID,START,INTERVAL,sec,...`), function names (`LowZ,ACV,DCV,DCmV,...,Burden,`) and unit strings.
- **Libraries:** ST Standard Peripheral Library (RCC, GPIO, LCD, PWR, TIM, NVIC, DMA, SDIO, EXTI), **FatFs R0.08a** (same as the bootloader; several functions match byte-for-byte), the same SDIO SD-card driver and disk glue as the bootloader, IAR double-precision floating point plus `log` (errno-setting, core at 0x080204C4 with the entry stub at 0x0801BB5C), and the IAR runtime.

## Hardware interfaces found so far

| Interface | Pins | Code |
|---|---|---|
| **HY3131** SPI (bit-banged) | PF1 = CS (low), PF0 = CK, PF2 = DI (MCU→HY), PF3 = DO (HY→MCU; IRQ output while CS is high) | write 0x0800C03C, read 0x0800C0C0. Frame: `reg<<1 \| R/W`, then data, auto-incrementing; reads have one turnaround clock |

## Control flow

- **Start-up:** `Reset_Handler` → `SystemInit` (0x08025F70) → `__cmain` (zero and LZ77 data init) → `main` (0x08024B40).
- **`main` set-up:** `NVIC_SetVectorTable(0x08000000, 0x6000)`, `system_init`, the PF8 detect, `0x08024DE0`, `0x0801B450(*(u8*)0x20000237, 1)`, then `0x0800EA3A`.
- **Main loop (cooperative, no RTOS):**
  1. `hy3131_poll`: if PF3 is high, `hy3131_service` reads registers 0x00–0x33 and dispatches the AD1-ready, RMS-ready, peak-hold and counter-ready handlers.
  2. Measurement post-processing when `0x2000805D` is set.
  3. Task flags set by TIM2:
     - `0x200080D0`: rotary, keys, input checks, display and front end
     - `0x200080D1`: display and range work
     - `0x200080D3`
     - `0x200080D4`, **1 s**: auto power-off countdown (`0x20000230`; 5 warning beeps at 60 s, `power_off` at 0) and the logging interval (`0x2000022C`/`0x20007FA8` → log record via `0x08010B64`)
  4. SD tasks, calibration-file tasks, and power-off when requested.
- **Interrupts:** TIM2 (the scheduler tick, 1,174 bytes), TIM3 (buzzer), USART2 (BLE), RTC wakeup, ADC1 (battery/temperature?), SDIO and DMA2 channel 4, SysTick. The EXTI0–15 handlers only clear their flags (wake-up sources).
- `0x2000803C` appears to be the current function/mode index (compared against 6, 7, 8, 0x0C).

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tools/ghidra_import.ps1`, `tools/ghidra_export.ps1` | import and re-export, with `ApplyNames.java` applying `ghidra/app_names.tsv` |
| `tools/fingerprint.py app` | per-function peripheral/RAM/fan-in summary (`docs/app_fingerprint.txt`) |
| `tools/match_functions.py` | functions byte-identical to identified bootloader code |
| `tools/iar_lz77.py` | IAR LZ77 initialiser decompressor |
| `tools/globals_access.py` | global memory accesses (address, width, read/write) of original functions |

## Reconstruction workflow (hybrid build)

The application is rebuilt module by module and verified before the whole firmware exists:

1. **Analyse:** decompile in Ghidra, check global access widths with `tools/globals_access.py`, and check subtle code against the disassembly. Signedness and stack out-parameters are the usual traps.
2. **Write C** in `firmware/src/`, with each function tagged `orig: 0x...`. Globals go in headers with their original addresses noted, and calls to code not yet rebuilt go through `firmware/include/orig_calls.h`.
3. **Hybrid build** (`cmake -S firmware -B build/firmware`): the rebuilt modules are linked at 0x08100000. Every global is bound to its original RAM address and every unreconstructed function to its original code (`tools/hybrid_syms.py`, using `ghidra/app_names.tsv`).
4. **Equivalence test** (`python -P tools/emu/test_app_functions.py`): each rebuilt function and its original run from identical randomised states, with boundary values taken from the original's compare constants, optionally as multi-step sequences. The test compares the return value, all RAM outside the stack, and every peripheral write. A planted off-by-one is caught.

5. **Standalone image** (`build/firmware/app.bin`, linked at 0x08006000 by `firmware/stm32l152xd_app.ld`): every function is rebuilt, so only RAM variables are bound to their original addresses (`tools/hybrid_syms.py --ram-only` fails if anything else is still needed). `firmware/src/startup.c` has the vector table and the start-up code; it clears 0x20001240..0x200080FB and copies the initialised variables (`firmware/src/ram_init.c`, generated by `tools/gen_ram_init.py`) to 0x20000000, as the IAR runtime does.
6. **Whole-firmware comparison** (`python -P tools/emu/compare_app.py <blocks> 0 --points --ticks=N`): the original image and the original bootloader plus `app.bin` boot from reset in the model. The timers tick at the loop heads of the start-up screen and the main loop (one TIM3 tick per visit, TIM2 every tenth), so both programs take interrupts at the same points. Both stop after N visits, and the comparison covers every peripheral write (main program and each interrupt separately) and all RAM outside the stack. With `--ticks=40000` (4000 TIM2 ticks, about 40 s of meter time: boot, start-up screen, measurement, display, keys, ADC, RTC) the runs are identical: 294,266 peripheral writes and the final RAM.
7. **On the meter:** `app.bin` was written to 0x08006000 over SWD (the bootloader, option bytes and EEPROM verified unchanged) and checked working on the hardware. The first flash found one timing problem the emulator can't see (see the `clock_init()` timing deviation below).

The globals keep their original addresses in the standalone image too; giving them ordinary C definitions is a later clean-up.

**Narrow parameters.** IAR callees extend their own `uint8_t`/`int16_t` arguments (`uxtb`/`sxth` on entry), while GCC relies on the caller having done it. Rebuilt functions whose original truncates an argument internally take the full register and truncate explicitly (for example `temp_for_display()`). In the final all-GCC build callers always extend, so this only matters while unrebuilt IAR code calls rebuilt functions in the hybrid image.

Known deviations, all for inputs that valid firmware state never produces:
- **NaN results:** IAR's soft-float runtime produces a *negative* default NaN (0xFFC00000) where GCC's libgcc produces a positive one, and that changes sign-dependent saturation later. NaN needs corrupt calibration data. A zero gain is handled explicitly; a NaN takes a gain below about 1e-44 (for example 0/0 in `apply_gain` with g_flag_80b9 set). The composite handler tests therefore use realistic gains, and the edge-case floats are covered by the `apply_gain` tests.
- **Float divide near FLT_MAX:** IAR's `fdiv` returns ±infinity for quotients just below FLT_MAX in magnitude (dividend within ~3% of FLT_MAX), where IEEE and libgcc give the finite value. Measurement values are many orders of magnitude smaller.
- `lcd_reapply_pulse_duration()` with a contrast outside 10–17 uses 0 where the original passes an uninitialised register.
- `hy3131_write_mode_registers()` / `hy3131_set_irq_enables()` with a function index above 0x18 use zeros / AD1 where the original uses an uninitialised stack buffer.
- `smooth3()` and the moving averages are tested with their counters in range (0–3 and 0–10), which is where the firmware keeps them. A corrupted counter could divide by zero: the Cortex-M3 returns 0 for that, while C leaves it undefined.
- Frequency overload (function 6 value of 10^9 counts or more, decade 9): the original stores an uninitialised register as the frequency or reading while flagging the overload. The rebuild leaves the previous value and stores only the decimal and the flag.
- Table rows beyond the end of the original's register-table blocks read code in the original. Every function has at most 4 rows in its smallest table, and real ranges stay inside the blocks.

Timing deviation found on the meter (the emulator has no clock):
- `clock_init()`: the original clears HSEON and then tests HSERDY once, hanging if it is still set. The flag takes a few HSE cycles to clear, which the original's two SPL calls cover. GCC reads RCC_CR on the next instruction, so the first flash of the rebuild hung there (the bootloader leaves the HSE running). The rebuild waits for HSERDY to clear instead: the same on any meter the original boots on, and it still hangs if the HSE never stops.

Original quirks that are reproduced deliberately:
- `adc_init()`: the external-trigger-edge field of the original's init struct is uninitialised. It is always 0 in the start-up sequence (checked in emulation with different RAM fills).
- `rotary_pins_config()`: for a non-one-hot code the pin mask is whatever the caller left in r2. In the only non-trivial call that is `RCC->AHBENR`, which the C caller passes explicitly.

## Runtime library (identified by behaviour)

`tools/emu/identify_math.py` calls helpers in the original with test operands and compares the results with reference IEEE/integer operations. The IAR routines found are float add/sub/mul/div, int/unsigned→float, float↔double, double add/mul/div, double/float→int and float→unsigned (all saturating; see `numeric.h`), unsigned→double, signed/unsigned 64-bit divide, int64→float, flag-setting float compares, double `sqrt` and double `log10`.

In the rebuild, the basic IEEE operations are left to GCC's libgcc, which gives bit-identical results for finite operands. Where a NaN can arise from realistic data, `iar_fdiv()` reproduces IAR's negative default NaN. Function 12 is one such case: an uncalibrated (all-zero) record makes 0/0. `iar_f2u()` reproduces IAR's saturating float→unsigned conversion: negatives give 0, values ≥ 2^32 give 0xFFFFFFFF, and NaN goes by its sign. IAR's 64-bit divides return the dividend unchanged when dividing by zero, and the Cortex-M3 hardware divide returns 0; `iar_uldiv()`, `iar_ldiv()` and `m3_udiv()` reproduce both. All three behaviours were checked by calling the original routines in emulation. Truncating conversions use `iar_d2i()`/`iar_f2i()`, which reproduce IAR's saturation. `(int)sqrt((double)n)` on 32-bit integers is replaced by an exact integer square root, which gives identical results. `log10` isn't required to be correctly rounded, so `iar_math.c` reproduces IAR's routine operation by operation (bit-identical, including errno).

## Calibration (found so far)

- `calibrate_zero_and_gain` (0x0800F7B8) averages 16 samples. It derives the zero offset as `p2 − (mean − p2)/9` and the gain as span / divisor, where the divisor depends on function and range (50000, 30000, 10000, 6000, 1000, or 30000·√2 for AC peak). It stores both through `cal_store_value` (0x08011B40).
- Calibration data lives in data EEPROM: byte reads at 0x08080000 + offset; byte writes with up to 10 retries; big-endian 16/32-bit helpers; and 0xA5 "valid" markers at offsets 0x1F and 0x26.
- `cal_address_for_range` (0x0801159C) gives the address as `table[g_function] + g_range·16`, with the table at 0x08028EE8 (26 entries; entry 25 = 0x2D0 is the AC-peak record).
- `cal_load(function, range)` (0x0801167C) loads the offset (+0) and gain (+4) into the working values. The gain is ÷1e6; for function 12 it is ÷1e5, or ÷1e4 in range 4 when PF8 reads low. Special cases:
  - index 200 loads the 16-bit value at 0x2E0 (limit ±1000);
  - function 6 loads the gain at 0x104 (40e6–60e6, default 49152050);
  - function 9 range 6 also loads 0x178;
  - dual-gain functions (13–15, 22–24) load two offset/gain pairs;
  - function 0 uses `table[1 or 2] + 0x30`, and function 10 uses `table[9] + 0x10`.
- Each record holds four signed 16-bit trims at +8. Their limits are ±20000, ±20000, ±10000 and ±10000, and an out-of-range trim reads as 0. Functions 16 and 18 always use their range-1 record.
- Functions 16–21 have an extra offset at 0x4D0 + 8·(function − 16): a 0xA5 marker followed by a big-endian int32. It is used for range 0 only.
- Trim capture (calibration mode, functions 2, 4, 16, 18, 20): trim n = reading − nominal. The nominal is 5000 for trims 1 and 3 and 50000 for trims 2 and 4, a tenth of that for function 2 range 3.
- The type K table (0x08025CF8) holds EMF in µV from −210 °C to +1360 °C in 10 °C steps. Readings are interpolated in 0.01 °C. Valid inputs run from −5891 µV (−200 °C) up to 54138 µV (1350 °C).

## Measurement processing (found so far)

- **Function 2 with 0x200080BA set (AC+DC):** the meter alternates between two HY3131 set-ups (0x200080BD selects the phase and the function 1 or 2 calibration record). It captures the reading after 5 readings in one phase and 3 in the other. The displayed value is √(a² + b²) through the second moving average.
- **Function 5 (temperature):** the thermocouple voltage plus a cold-junction offset (0x20007E7C) is converted to 0.01 °C, or to °F when 0x200080AB is 0, and then to 0.1°. The original rounds up when the last digit of the already-divided value is 5 or more, not the discarded digit. This is reproduced.
- **Function 9 (and 10, which adds the threshold beeper):** negative readings are clipped except in range 0. Range 5 subtracts a correction (0 to 15 counts) that rises and falls with the reading. Range 6 subtracts `g_cal_e14 × curve / 100`, where the curve is a 13-point table of percentages. A reading of exactly 0 makes the original interpolate from the word before that table; the rebuild keeps that word, so the result is identical.
- **Function 11:** a reading within ±999 keeps the buzzer on. A change of more than 1000 gives one triple beep until 0x200080B4 is cleared.
- **Functions 2 and 4 with g_flag_80b9:** the reading is scaled by a gain (1000 = unity) for the measured frequency (20 Hz–6 kHz, 216 points). There are separate tables for low (< 100000) and high (> 500000) readings, blended linearly between them. Below 20 Hz the reading is unchanged; above 6 kHz it becomes 0. At exactly 20 Hz the original interpolates from the word before the frequency table; the rebuild keeps the tables contiguous, so the result is identical.
- **Trim correction** (functions 2, 4, 16, 18, 20, outside calibration and without g_flag_80b9): the four 16-bit trims give offsets at two levels. Percentage tables per frequency point scale them for the measured frequency (above 50 Hz), and the result is interpolated in level between the knee (low offset + 5000 counts, or + 600 for selection 5, which is function 2 range 3 or function 4 range 5) and 50000. Function 2 range 0 can add a further frequency-dependent offset (g_flag_8087).
- **Functions 16–21 (VA):** outside calibration with g_flag_80a5 set, the meter alternates between the main measurement and a borrowed function, function 2 for 16/18/20 and function 1 for 17/19/21. It switches on the 7th or 4th new reading respectively. The borrowed reading is smoothed into 0x20007E6C, and 0x200080A7 records whether it is above 5000.
- **Functions 22–24:** a fixed offset by range and by the signs of a reference value and the reading is added when |reading| > 2500 (PF8 high, g_flag_7fe0 set).
- **Functions 13–15 and 22–24 (two readings):** these alternate between a reference reading and a level reading (phase 0x200080C4). Functions 13–15 take them via functions 2 and 16, and functions 22–24 via functions 1 and 17. Each phase discards 3 or 6 readings after a switch. Each reading auto-ranges independently with its own range bit (0x200080C6/C7): up above 55000, down below 3200 or 4000 (11000/400 for functions 15/24 in the upper range). The range is then `sel_code()` of the two bits. The product of the two readings is computed after every pair. In calibration the two offsets or gains are averaged over 3 cycles inside the dispatcher.
- **Reference correction for those functions:** a bilinear interpolation in 9×8 grids (one per function, range and PF8 state), indexed by level band and reference band. Level band 8, used when 0x200080CC doesn't match the function, reads row 9, which is the first row of the next grid. Function 15 ranges 2/3 (PF8 high) use 7-word rows at offsets inside another grid. The rebuild keeps all grids as one block addressed by flash offset, so these reads are identical.
- The second moving average is used with up to 20 samples (function 9 range 6). Its buffer at 0x20007238 has 400 bytes free before the next variable, so the rebuild declares 20 entries.

## Counter functions (found so far)

- Each counter interrupt captures CTA (0x15), CTB (0x18) and CTC (0x1B) and restarts the counter. The reference count is CTC + (0x1000000 − preset·256), where the preset is at 0x2000001C.
- The function 6 value is gain·CTB·10/(reference/10). It is divided (rounded) by 10^decade and either shown (function 6) or stored as the secondary frequency (functions 0, 2, 4, 16, 18, 20). Auto-range moves up at each decade and down at 80 % of it. Manual range (0x20008042 outside calibration) flags an overload instead.
- Function 6 calibration sets gain = reference·150000000/(CTB·100).
- Function 7 = reference·100000/(gain/1000·CTB) · (CTA per ms of reference)/1000, over ranges 0–2.
- Function 8 = CTA per ms of reference.
- Function 12 = CTA/CTB (×100 for the higher ranges), less the zero offset, divided by the gain. It is averaged with a window of 1/50 of the value (at least 20). Readings below 21 in ranges 2–4 read 0. In range 4 with manual range, 0x200080A4 readings are held back.

Accepted commands are echoed back over USART2.

## Display (found so far)

- The LCD has ten 7-segment digits. Digits 0–4 are the **secondary** readout and digits 5–9 the **main** readout; the manual confirms this, since the internal temperature, burden voltage, diode test voltage and log count all appear on the secondary display. Each digit's segment code holds two segment columns per COM row (bits 7–6 COM0 … 1–0 COM3). In COM0 the bit-6 column is the decimal point to the left of the digit, which the font never sets. `lcd_set_secondary_dp()` (0x08017FB4) and `lcd_set_main_dp()` (0x0801717E) drive the decimal points. Earlier parts had these two names the other way round.
- Minus signs: shadow[4] bit 29 (secondary), shadow[3] bit 7 (main).
- The bar graph has 26 segments in SEG1–SEG7 (rows zig-zag). Its length is |value|/400 or /2000 depending on the range, and it is full on overload.
- `display_update()` (0x08016D34) runs from the main loop. It redraws whatever was flagged: the main readout on a new reading (`g_new_reading`), the secondary readout (`g_disp_flag_8062`), the bar graph (`g_scaled_ready`), the symbol groups (`g_flag_8060`, `g_flag_8061`, `g_flag_804c`) and the secondary annunciators when `g_mode_8037` changes. It then calls `lcd_update()` once. Nothing is drawn while the setup menu is active.
- `g_mode_8037` selects what the secondary readout shows: 0 temperature, 1 battery ("BATnn"), 2 APO setting, 3 beep setting, 4 LCD contrast, 5 year, 6 date pair, 7 time pair, 8 an edited value, 9 log interval ("Innn"), 10/11/12 per-function auxiliary values (burden value, dBm, frequency, dual readings, diode voltage, "bd" settings), and 100 the log count.
- Texts found: " LEAD", "-----", " OFL ", " OPEN", " CAL ", "LoBAt", "SdEnd", "SdEnn", "burdn", "Lcd-n", "APO.oN/oF", "b-On/b-OFF", "bd.On/bd.OFF", "DN 30/UP 30/DN300/UP300", "OFF-E", "G-END", "400-E", "5KEND", and "-x-nn" (averaging/calibration step counters).

## Test harness notes

- `tools/emu/test_app_functions.py --shard i/n` runs every n-th spec; the full suite is run as 16 parallel shards.
- Spec keys added for the SD/FatFs work: `prep` (original functions run on both machines first, for example card initialisation and `f_mount`), `regs` (peripheral registers preset in the model, for example NVIC enables and VTOR so the original SDIO/DMA interrupt handlers run), `ignore` (RAM that legitimately differs, such as a FatFs `DIR.fn` pointer into the caller's stack) and stack arguments beyond r0–r3.
- The emulator now models SD multi-block writes (ACMD23, CMD25, CMD12 and DMA to the card) and compares the card contents of both runs.
- FatFs is linked into the hybrid image unmodified; its two static variables (`FatFs[]`, `Fsid`) are placed at the original addresses 0x20007C58 and 0x20007F98 by `firmware/hybrid.ld`.

## Start-up summary

- `SystemInit` (before C start-up) briefly runs the 16 MHz HSE PLL, with a 0x5000-iteration HSE timeout.
- `system_init()`, called from `main`:
  1. Handles wake from standby (flag in 0x20007FDE).
  2. Forces the BOR level to 0.
  3. Sets voltage range 1, then switches to **MSI 4.194 MHz with HSE and LSE off and HSI on** (for the ADC).
  4. Clocks the RTC/LCD from LSI and enables debug in low-power modes.
  5. Sets up board GPIO: control outputs, HY3131/RTC buses, rotary/key pins with pull-ups, ADC inputs PA4/PA5/PF11/PF13/PF14.
  6. Initialises ADC1 (12-bit, single, software trigger), the NVIC (group 2: SDIO and DMA2 channel 4 at 0/0, TIM3 at 1/1, TIM2 at 2/2), **TIM2 ≈ 99.8 Hz** (scheduler) and **TIM3 ≈ 1 kHz**.
- `front_end_select(function)` drives PD0, PF4, PF5, PC11 and PD7 per measurement function (100 = idle).

## HY3131 configuration

- Each measurement function index (0–0x18) and range selects a 20-byte image of HY3131 registers 0x20–0x33 (R20 counter control … R33 oscillator) from tables in flash. The data is generated into `firmware/src/hy3131_tables.c` by `tools/gen_hy3131_tables.py`.
- Some functions select rows by range, others by 0x200080C6/C7 under a flag at 0x200080C4.
- INTE per function: AD1 only for most functions; AD1 + counter for functions 13–16, 18 and 20; counter only for 6–8 and 12; RMS + counter for 2/4 when 0x200080B7 = 1.
- The counter restart presets CTA from 0x2000001C (default 0xE000).
- `hy3131_service` reads registers 0x00–0x33 in one burst and dispatches to four result handlers still to be reconstructed: AD1 0x080061E4, RMS 0x08008208, peak 0x0800A7FC, counter 0x0800AA00.

## Findings from the reconstruction so far

- **Keys:** PG8–PG15 are the keys (`g_keys_raw` bit n = PG(8+n)). PG0–PG7 are the rotary switch (`g_rotary_raw` bit n = PG(7−n)).
  - Debounce is two equal samples.
  - A long press fires after 50 scan ticks. It applies to single keys and the PG11+PG13 combination (the bootloader's update keys).
  - PG14/PG15 auto-repeat in the menu: after 3 ticks in the menu (50 elsewhere), then 5 repeats at 30 ticks, then every 10 ticks.
- **Settings in initialised data:** 0x2000022C log interval (1 s), 0x2000022E the 1 kHz countdown used by the start-up screen (500), 0x20000230 auto power-off (1800 s), 0x20000237 LCD contrast (14).
- **LCD:** the application drives three more segment pins than the bootloader (PA15, PB3, PB4). The display shadow is 16 words at 0x20007790. Numbers go through `number_to_digits` → `digits_to_text` (signed digits, leading-zero blanking) → glyph rendering (still to be reconstructed).
- **RTC:** writes send address + 1, values are BCD, and the date/time registers are 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 14.
- **Keys:** 0x01 MODE, 0x02 SETUP, 0x04 MIN/MAX, 0x08 MEM, 0x10 RANGE, 0x20 HOLD, 0x40 REL, 0x80 PEAK. Long presses: MODE backlight (PE8), SETUP edit/store the setting shown, MIN/MAX off, MEM logging on/off, RANGE back to auto, MEM+HOLD logging in auto-hold mode, REL 1 kHz filter (functions 2/4) or VA zero offset, PEAK BLE on/off. The BLE app's button events 1..8 (0x81..0x88 long) map to RANGE, HOLD, REL, PEAK, MODE, MIN/MAX, MEM, SETUP.
- **Start-up keys** (version screen, ~2 s): MODE then REL enters calibration mode; MEM shows "SdCAL", then REL (save) or PEAK (restore) and MODE to confirm copy EEPROM bytes 0..0x4AF to/from `cal.bin`; SETUP makes the serial prefix follow the clock; RANGE lights all segments.
- **HOLD pressed twice** enters auto-hold (0x20008050): after the input drops below 1000 counts, the next reading that stays within 20 counts on two updates (and differs by more than 400 counts from the held one) is captured with a short beep and logged when logging.
- **Quirks kept as in the original:**
  - In calibration mode SETUP starts calibration step 0 and then falls into the MEM-key code, so a successful start is answered with three beeps.
  - The log read-back (`log_verify`) keeps reading after a mismatching block without advancing its buffer position and ends with success unless a read fails.
  - `rtc_days_in_month` reads past its table for months outside 1..12 (the rebuild returns 0 there).
- **IRQ-shared variable:** the start-up countdown 0x2000022E must be `volatile` in C (the original re-reads it while polling; GCC would otherwise keep it in a register).
